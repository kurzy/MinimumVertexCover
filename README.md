# MinimumVertexCover
C++ program to approximate the minimum vertex cover of various [DIMACS-C graphs](https://turing.cs.hbg.psu.edu/txn131/clique.html).

## Requirements
* g++ compiler
* `make` utility

## Compiling
Simply execute `make` within the directory of `makefile`

## Executing
Execute `s5007230_ass3.exe graph.clq` where `graph.clq` is the name of the clique file.

## Output
The minimum vertex cover found by the program will be output to *[graph.clq]_COVER.csv*
